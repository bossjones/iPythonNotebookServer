### What Does This Do?

This is a tiny Mac OS X app that will run an iPython notebook server for you. And shut it down when you quit it.

The app opens .ipynb files by default when you double click them in the Finder. Bonus!

### How to Install

1. Make sure you have iPython. If you don't, install the excellent [brew package manager](http://brew.sh) and then run ```brew install python; pip install ipython[notebook]``` in Terminal.app.
2. Download the [iPythonNotebook.app](https://github.com/dpinney/iPythonNotebookServer/releases/download/v1.0.0/iPythonNotebook.app.zip), put it wherever you want.

### Credits

We used Sveinbjorn Thordarson's [Platypus.app](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to make this quick and dirty .app.

Also thanks to WasteOfAMan for his Creative Commons licensed iPyNotebook App we use from his [Faneza Extra Icons](http://wasteofaman.deviantart.com/art/Faneza-extra-icons-539097199) collection.

And of course none of this would work without [iPython](http://ipython.org).
