### What Does This Do?

This is a tiny Mac OS X app that will run an iPython notebook server for you. And shut it down when you quit it.

The app opens .ipynb files by default when you double click them in the Finder. Bonus!

### How to Install

Make sure you have iPython. Running ```brew install ipython``` in Terminal.app will install it if you have the excellent [brew package manager](http://brew.sh).

Download the [iPythonNotebook.app](https://github.com/dpinney/iPythonNotebookServer/releases/download/v1.0.0/iPythonNotebook.app.zip), put it wherever you want.
